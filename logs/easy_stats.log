2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.
2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 Your version is 3.11
2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 Here's some time series data:
2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 xtimes:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 yvalues:[2, 5, 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 31, 32]
2023-05-11 21:35:36,073 correlation between xtimes and xtimes = 1.00
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 correlation between xtimes and yvalues = 0.94
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 x:[-200, -150, -100, 50, 0, 50, 100, 150]
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 y:[-240, -165, -99, 35, 19, 75, 130, 125]
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074    slope = 1.09
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074    intercept = -1.39
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074    At future x = 200,
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074    we predict the value of y will be 216.
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 Remember to close the app. Control c (or d or z maybe) to close it.
2023-05-11 21:35:36,074 ready_for_chart = True
2023-05-11 21:35:58,567 Done with the chart.
